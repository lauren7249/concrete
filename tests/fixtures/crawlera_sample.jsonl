Our children face things today that threaten their health and safety: bullying, body image issues, school violence, drugs, internet safety, etc.. What can we as moms DO to fix all this? We can do a lot – and we can do it most effectively TOGETHER. Who better to solve the social issues our kids face than the moms who love them? We may not be soldiers on the front lines, but we are soldiers nonetheless, fighting for our children’s lives; fighting to keep our kids healthy, sane, happy, safe. Moms, you’re invited to participate in productive, effective discussions around understanding and solving the social problems our children face. Participate in our online community, utilize our directory of resources, watch our podcast, start a crowd-funding campaign, or even run for political office!

It turns out that I like to eat more than I like to cook. As luck would have it my father had been designing toys for more than 20 years and needed some help. I have had a passion for all things mechanical since I was young. Taking things apart to see how they work was endless fun.\n In middle school, a local bike shop hired me part time, building and repairing bicycles. After 15+ years of running the repair department, I thought it was time to try something new. Though my love of bicycles has diminished some with age, I still marvel at the simple mechanics and the joy it brings to many.\n I ventured out on my own in 2007 and haven't looked back.\n I have been designing and building mechanical prototypes for over 20 years and have amassed a sizable knowledge of how things work. This ranges from being able to manipulate plastics, light machining, molding in different mediums, and fabrications. To build a working prototype from a simple drawing or verbal description has been a difficult skill to master. Development is not an exact science, and can take time, and trial and error to get things to work in their intended way.\n I am a one man operation who develops all prototypes in house and by hand. Everything is done as a one-of-a-kind item and if multiples are required molds will need to be made. Sadly I do not have the capability of programming electronics.\n\n Please contact me if you have a project that you just can't get your head around and want to bring to life. I would love to have the opportunity to talk to you about it.","skills":["Product Development","Team Building","New Business Development","Proof of Concept","Engineering","Customer Service","Business Development","Molding","3D Printing","Fusion 360","Woodworking","Small Business","Project Management","Product Management","Model Making","Consumer Products","Brand Development","Packaging"],"image_url":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/1/000/023/212/15190cd.jpg"}

During this apprenticeship I also work as a Technician for Miracle Method Surface Refinishing, where because of my hard work ethic and goal driven personality I have earned the title of Lead Master Technician.","headline":"Lead Master Technician at Miracle Method Chicago NW Metro","also_viewed":["http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tanner-pratt/58/470/387","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-heian/1b/52b/486","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rachel-black/42/922/507","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/zayra-valencia/6b/129/710","http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/great-ping/70/835/44a","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/remnant-skate/30/5b3/a99","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/alber-arslanian/4/b55/b42","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/marilyn-paggi/5/b01/967","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/zachary-patchan/aa/ba5/aa","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tanner-pratt/42/1b7/b12"],"image_url":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/5/005/03c/3a7/005d4c4.jpg","given_name":"Brandon","full_name":"Brandon Oneida","skills":["Sales","Retail","Microsoft Office","Marketing","PowerPoint","Time Management","Inventory Management","Microsoft Excel","Outlook","Data Entry","Hockey","Coaching","Microsoft Word","Team-oriented","Training","Teamwork"],"education":[{"degrees":["Associates","Applied Science; Business Administration"],"name":"Robert Morris University-IL"},{"degrees":["Bachelor's","Applied Science; Business Management"],"name":"Robert Morris University-IL"}],"canonical_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brandon-oneida/42/713/972"}

I have also had the honor of being well trusted to manage a store when the need had arisen and proven the owners could rely on me to help when they needed it at any their locations.","title":"Sales associate","start":"July 1996","location":"Dearborn, Michigan","duration":"19 years 2 months","organization":[{"name":"Lynch's, Inc."}]}],"headline":"Administrative Assistant at AIT Worldwide Logistics","also_viewed":["http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joo-kwak/6b/74b/a75","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kenneth-silveous/64/32b/760","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bill-mylius/32/60/288","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lisa-kariores/81/274/307","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/may-chanpalangsri/70/728/999","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/vanity-frison/59/817/419","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tameeka-bowens/6b/32/5ba","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jenny-karolyi/94/94a/686","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/remnant-skate/30/5b3/a99","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/marilyn-paggi/5/b01/967","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sharon-haudek/23/53/56b"],"given_name":"Jennifer","full_name":"Jennifer Karolyi","skills":["Retail","Customer Service","Microsoft Office","PowerPoint","Excel","Teamwork","Problem Solving","Stores","Product Knowledge","Polite","Open-minded"],"education":[{"start":"1998","end":"2012","name":"Wayne County Community College District","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/edu/school?id=31963","degrees":["Associates of Science"]}],"canonical_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jennifer-karolyi/45/bb1/449"}

She has an entrepreneurial spirit and is very dependable and flexible. I had the pleasure of working with Julia when I was directing the annual fundraising campaign for the Konojel Nutrition Center in San Marcos La Laguna, Guatemala. Julia was brought onboard to handle graphic design for the center and for the fundraising campaign, and it quickly became apparent that her strategic contribution would also be an invaluable asset to the team. I observed Julia interpret client briefs into visual concepts such as brochures, posters and logos, and demonstrate a strong willingness to come to the table with different creative approaches. Throughout the planning process, Julia's voice was instrumental, strong, and diplomatic in communication and fundraising strategy discussions. I was especially impressed when Julia strategically conceived of social media mechanisms, such as customized \"thank you\" graphics to post on each participant's and donor's wall with a strong copy line, that exponentially increased reach of our campaign. Not only did Julia proactively create these items in addition to briefed material, but she also came to the team with the creative solution already worked up. She gave the campaign a strong visual identity, and helped us achieve more than double our previous year's fundraising. She showed both sharp responsiveness and leadership. While I worked directly with Julia on Konojel, I can also attest to witnessing the same dedication, creativity and social leadership across many community projects. Julia's ability to integrate and impact the local community of Mayan descent was outstanding and her commitment to making a social contribution apparent. She taught children to speak new languages, inspired adults to bring out their creativity again, and helped local women turn skills into crafts that could promote their independence and welfare. Julia holds a diverse and impressive set of talents, skills, ambitions and social abilities that will be an incredible advantage to anyone who has the good fortune to employ her. Sincerely, Aimee Hansen","Julia is a pleasure to work alongside, always bringing a fresh perspective and a warm laugh. She is dedicated, very talented, open-minded and is willing to do what it takes to get a job done well and on time. While I worked with Julia she managed many diverse roles and projects and in many ways held the school together through the strength of her organizational and communication skills. I look forward to working with Julia again some time!"],"groups":[{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/2/005/033/16e/020a5a7.png","name":"Careers in Diplomacy","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1830963"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/3/000/021/334/07847f7.png","name":"Minnesota Council of Nonprofits","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1891637"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAOfAAAAJDU0YmVjNWQ2LTk1ODUtNDBlMi05YzA0LWMzNjVlOTVmMDEzOA.png","name":"Impact Investing Forum- The Voice of Impact Investing","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1913772"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/5/005/0a5/392/218d6b3.png","name":"Free Arts Minnesota","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=41971"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/3/000/01d/07a/1b425ab.png","name":"Jobs in Nonprofits","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1814873"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/1/005/0b1/33c/2e9e164.png","name":"Impact Investing Network: Impact Capitalism","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=45668"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/6/005/079/08b/0a50402.png","name":"Wisconsin Evening and Executive MBA Programs","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1905579"},{"logo_url":"https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/img/icon/group/icon_group_100x50_v2.png","name":"Project Coordinator professionals","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2197326"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/2/000/001/286/30dc580.png","name":"Americans for the Arts","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=41332"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/3/000/01c/0da/188b420.png","name":"CGAP, Consultative Group to Assist the Poor","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1795011"},{"logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/media/p/2/000/02b/201/308a9fb.png","name":"Volunteer Coordinators","profile_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1911260"}],"projects":[{"date":"March 2013","description":"Alma de Colores is a program that provides employment to youth and young adults with disabilities in the Lake Atitlán region of Guatemala.

To start using the FTP2S3, customer should launch the Cloud Formation template, specifying the desired S3 bucket name and FTP server users’ credentials. No explicit AWS credentials required, authorization on S3 is implemented with Amazon IAM Roles through the instance configuration using the Cloud Formation template. FTP2S3 server is a multi-threaded stand-alone java application that relies on the Apache FTP server (Mina project) and Amazon Java SDK integration. Project team consists of 3 people: java developer (main project functionality development), automation QA engineer (functional and load testing), maintenance engineer (Cloud Formation template and custom machine image creation.) Personal contribution: main project functionality development. Technology stack: • Java • Apache FTP server with NIO listeners (Mina project) • Amazon Java SDK • JCommander • Spring Framework • Maven • Amazon Cloud Formation template • Custom AWS Machine Image (possibly on AWS Marketplace) The FTP2S3 server’s design load is 100 simultaneous connections if launching the server on the m1.medium AWS instance.","members":[{"url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/artem-rozumenko/12/36/974","full_name":"Artem Rozumenko"},{"url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sergii-sasunov/34/468/816","full_name":"Sergii Sasunov"},{"url":"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrey-melekhovskiy/53/949/736","full_name":"Andrey Melekhovskiy"}],"title":"FTP2S3 Proxy as a Service Project"},{"date":"January 2008","description":"Norton Smartphone Security provides secure mobile computing through comprehensive, reliable protection against malicious attacks that are directed at mobile devices.

Although I played all sports growing up, I gravitated towards basketball. That enabled me to join the LaSalle Explorers in 1981-82 as an incoming freshmen. Although a severe ankle injury curtailed my playing time as a freshmen, it also turned out to be a blessing in disguise. After doing much soul searching and trying to figure out what life was all about, in the spring of 1982, I cried out to a God I wasnt sure existed. I asked Jesus Christ to forgive me of my destructive life and sin, and asked Him to take over my life. THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE! I became a new person (2 Corith 5:17) that day. That decision to turn my life over to Christ and give Him the keys to the steering wheel of my life; has enabled me to fufill my destiny and calling the last 32 years.\n\n I graduated in 1985. Then got married in 1986 and have 2 beautiful girls. I went into the restaurant business in 1989 for 8 years. I always served in church life no matter where we were living. In 1994, I joined the Saints Prison Ministry, the largest athletic prison ministry in the US, and have been in over 200 prisons playing basketball and sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. That ministry experience brought to the forefront the desire to minister full time. In 1997, I became a Full-time missionary with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, serving as the South Jersey Area Director for FCA. Working with FCA has opened numerous doors in schools and communities, but it also opened another door. In 2001-02, I began as the Philadelphia 76ers team chaplain and having been serving in the NBA the last 13 years.

We offer a balance of Chinese culture and leadership/problem solving skills enrichment, which campers will be able to apply to their present and future lifestyles. Our camp’s primary goal is to educate young Americans the importance of Chinese cultural roots and how these cultural roots manifest in their daily lives. To build leadership skills, problem solving and confidence through activities they do not normally see in school. Our camp is unique in the range of classes/activities we offer. The camp experience not only includes an introduction to Chinese Culture (such as Chinese yo-yo folk dancing, painting, arts & crafts, calligraphy) but also group activities like the banquet, carnival, and talent show. Each year, we invite teachers from Taiwan to join our camp to teach some core Chinese cultural classes. Each teacher is a master in his/her respective cultural subject and delivers a more enhanced learning experience to our campers. Additionally, we have a pool of local talented teachers who teach classes such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), hip hop dance, kung fu, basketball and film. http://chineseyouthcamp.com","title":"Volunteer Steering Committee"}],"url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidtwu","industry":"Financial Services","num_connections":"500+","experience":[{"end":"Present","description":"Advise lower middle market, owner operated businesses in structuring agreements to finance short/long-term working capital, equipment, acquisitions/divestures, and Commercial Real Estate financing needs.

I customize strategies for your business that will matter when YOU need them the MOST.\n\n Business banking and loan strategies are critical, and it can be hard to find a bank that will value your company today and tomorrow. Comerica Bank approaches business owners in a different way, a personal way. I can put solutions in place that will improve the collection of your cash flow and prolong the disbursements of your payables.\n\n Control over your financial position combined with a strong relationship increases your visibility in the marketplace. At Comerica, we listen to the client and tailor creative and innovative solutions that fit the particular needs of our clients as opposed to a “one size fits all approach”.\n\n Specialties: Commercial loans including real estate, lines of credit, equipment loans, construction lending, business expansions, partners buy in / buy out. Additional specialties include, treasury management solutions, SBA 7(a), SBA 504, Export Working Capital Loans, International Trade Export Loans and portfolio management.\n\n Mission Statement:\n A Bank’s job by definition is returning people's belongings better than they found it; whether it be interest on their deposits, or growing their business. A bank is human at its core because those that ethically practice this ideology are bound together by something more powerful and distinctive: an unwavering commitment to each other.\n\n I believe that our character and values define our working experience, not the other way around, and this is what forms the foundation of a unique, caring and collaborative culture.\n\n I believe that this appreciation for our relationships with customers and colleagues will serve to distinguish us from other financial institutions.\n\n I believe that in this way, every day, we are raising the expectations of what a bank can be.","skills":["Underwriting","Sales Management","Credit Analysis","Variance Analysis","Business Analysis","Financial Modeling","Qualitative Research","Deal Structuring","Executive Reporting","Report Writing","Direct Sales","Inside Sales","Cash Flow Management","Cash Flow Forecasting","Collateral Management","Pricing Analysis","Spreadsheets","Transaction Processing","AFS","Loan Structuring","Loan Modification","Loan Origination","Construction Loans","Real Estate Transactions","Equipment Finance","Sales Presentations","Capital Markets","Working Capital...","Financial Statement...","Tax Accounting","International Tax","IFRS","US GAAP","Stock Exchange","IPO","Mezzanine","Structured Finance","Securities Offerings","Pricing Strategy","Baker Hill","RMA","CPA","Auditing","Time Management","Priority Management","Management","Risk Assessment","Business Intelligence","Business Development","Finance"],"image_url":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/2/000/115/311/299eb59.jpg","recommendations":"9"}
